## TASK ONE – Problem and Audience

**Questions:**

- What problem are you trying to solve?  
  - Why is this a problem?  
- Who is the audience that has this problem and would use your solution?  
  - Do they nod their head up and down when you talk to them about it?  
  - Think of potential questions users might ask.  
  - What problem are they solving (writing companion)?

**InsightFlow AI Solution:**

**Problem Statement:**
InsightFlow AI addresses the challenge of limited perspective in research and decision-making by providing multiple viewpoints on complex topics.

**Why This Matters:**
When exploring complex topics, most people naturally approach problems from a single perspective, limiting their understanding and potential solutions. Traditional search tools and AI assistants typically provide one-dimensional answers that reflect a narrow viewpoint or methodology.

Our target users include researchers, students, journalists, and decision-makers who need to understand nuanced topics from multiple angles. These users often struggle with confirmation bias and need tools that deliberately introduce diverse reasoning approaches to help them see connections and contradictions they might otherwise miss.

**Deliverables:**

- Write a succinct 1-sentence description of the problem.
- Write 1–2 paragraphs on why this is a problem for your specific user.

---

## TASK TWO – Propose a Solution

**Prompt:**  
Paint a picture of the "better world" that your user will live in. How will they save time, make money, or produce higher-quality output?

**Deliverables:**

- What is your proposed solution?  
  - Why is this the best solution?  
  - Write 1–2 paragraphs on your proposed solution. How will it look and feel to the user?  
  - Describe the tools you plan to use in each part of your stack. Write one sentence on why you made each tooling choice.

**Tooling Stack:**

- **LLM**  
- **Embedding**  
- **Orchestration**  
- **Vector Database**  
- **Monitoring**  
- **Evaluation**  
- **User Interface**  
- *(Optional)* **Serving & Inference**

**Additional:**  
Where will you use an agent or agents? What will you use "agentic reasoning" for in your app?

**InsightFlow AI Solution:**

**Solution Overview:**
InsightFlow AI is a multi-perspective research assistant that analyzes questions from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. The implemented solution offers six distinct reasoning perspectives (analytical, scientific, philosophical, factual, metaphorical, and futuristic) that users can mix and match to create a custom research team for any query.

**User Experience:**
When a user poses a question, InsightFlow AI processes it through their selected perspectives, with each generating a unique analysis. These perspectives are then synthesized into a cohesive response that highlights key insights and connections. The system automatically generates visual representations, including Mermaid.js concept maps and DALL-E hand-drawn style visualizations, making complex relationships more intuitive. Users can customize their experience with command-based toggles and export complete insights as PDF or markdown files for sharing or reference.

**Technology Stack:**
- **LLM**: OpenAI's GPT models powering both perspective generation and synthesis
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph for workflow management with nodes for planning, execution, synthesis, and visualization
- **Visualization**: Mermaid.js for concept mapping and DALL-E for creative visual synthesis
- **UI**: Chainlit with command-based interface for flexibility and control
- **Document Generation**: FPDF and markdown for creating exportable documents

## TASK THREE – Dealing With the Data

**Prompt:**  
You are an AI Systems Engineer. The AI Solutions Engineer has handed off the plan to you. Now you must identify some source data that you can use for your application.

Assume that you'll be doing at least RAG (e.g., a PDF) with a general agentic search (e.g., a search API like Tavily or SERP).

Do you also plan to do fine-tuning or alignment? Should you collect data, use Synthetic Data Generation, or use an off-the-shelf dataset from Hugging Face Datasets or Kaggle?

**Task:**  
Collect data for (at least) RAG and choose (at least) one external API.

**Deliverables:**

- Describe all of your data sources and external APIs, and describe what you'll use them for.  
- Describe the default chunking strategy that you will use. Why did you make this decision?  
- *(Optional)* Will you need specific data for any other part of your application? If so, explain.

**InsightFlow AI Implementation:**

**Data Sources:**
InsightFlow AI leverages a variety of data sources for each of its six reasoning perspectives:

1. **Analytical Reasoning**: 
   - Project Gutenberg literary works (Sherlock Holmes collections)
   - arXiv papers on logical analysis and reasoning patterns
   - Algorithmia data on analytical methodologies

2. **Scientific Reasoning**:
   - Feynman lectures and scientific writings
   - David Deutsch's works on quantum computation and multiverse theory
   - PubMed research papers in various scientific disciplines
   - arXiv papers on empirical methodology and scientific process

3. **Philosophical Reasoning**:
   - Classic philosophical texts (Plato's Republic, Socratic dialogues)
   - Works of Vivekananda and Jiddu Krishnamurti on spiritual philosophy
   - Naval Ravikant's philosophical approaches to wealth, happiness, and meaning
   - Academic analyses of philosophical concepts
   - Historical philosophical discourse collections

4. **Factual Reasoning**:
   - Hannah Fry's mathematical and data-driven explanations
   - Encyclopedic knowledge bases
   - Statistical datasets and reports
   - Factual documentation across various domains

5. **Metaphorical Reasoning**:
   - Literary works rich in metaphor and analogy
   - Collections of creative analogies for technical concepts
   - Culturally diverse metaphorical expressions

6. **Futuristic Reasoning**:
   - Isaac Asimov's science fiction works (Foundation series, Robot series)
   - qntm's (Sam Hughes) works including "There Is No Antimemetics Division" and "Ra"
   - H.G. Wells and other science fiction literature
   - Technological forecasting papers
   - Future studies and trend analysis reports

**Persona Configurations**: JSON files defining characteristics, prompts, and examples for each reasoning perspective, ensuring consistent yet distinct viewpoints.

**OpenAI API Integration**: Used for generating perspective-specific insights and creating DALL-E visualizations.

**Chunking Strategy:**
InsightFlow AI implements semantic chunking to optimize its embedded RAG model. Rather than basic text splitting, we analyze content meaning and preserve conceptual units. This semantic approach ensures each chunk maintains coherent reasoning within each perspective, leading to more comprehensive and contextually appropriate responses. The chunking process varies by reasoning type - scientific papers maintain methodology/results together, while philosophical texts preserve argument structures.
