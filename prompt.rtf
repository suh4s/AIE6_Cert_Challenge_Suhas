\f0\fs28 \cf2 we were building app.py from first principles from scratch using tdd and these contexts: @app_py_tutorial_summary.md @InsightFlowAI_Ideas.md . The chainlit cookbook @https://github.com/Chainlit/cookbook and @https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit implementations along with the chainlit docs give context of the all the ways we can use chainlit. The look and functionality I want to achieve for my InsightFlow AI is the slickness and dopeness of this implementation @https://medium.com/mitb-for-all/its-2025-start-using-chainlit-for-your-llm-apps-558db1a46315 @https://medium.com/mitb-for-all/its-2025-take-your-llm-apps-to-the-next-level-with-chainlit-00036c8db1ba#111f-7fbcc3cba0b1 @https://github.com/suh4s/sturdy-octo-fortnight \
\
I also want to download my dataset, implement RAG for all of my personas, do embedded finetuning of the RAG using RAGAS metrics.\
\
While you do this, evaluate and provide the best llm choices for each of my personas - make the choice of choosing an llm change if necessary as simple as selecting from a config file - enable these choices from variables that can also be consumed in a huggingfaces spaces deployment. \
\
Retain my cool % complete feature - make it dope if possible else retain what I have.\
\
The functionality in @https://huggingface.co/spaces/suh4s/InsightFlowAI  should be enabled in the slick dope chainlit UI - primary goal is to reduce the choices one can make to be done through selections/toggle next to the attachment icon instead of always typing /<command> - we should retain the /<command> option for backup but the UI should enable the access to my app to be as simple as possible while enabling all the functionality I have built. There should also be a session level history and search option. Eventual result display should be as clear, easy to consume and exportable along with great design to render the diagrams and plots from plotly where necessary and the mermaid summary rendered properly.\
\
Before embarking on building those things out, understand the extend of my tdd and complete the implementation. }
